# Mission & principles

## Mission

This project is part of [INFUSIÓN](www.infusionvlc.com). In case you don't know
what **INFUSIÓN** is, it's a **community** based in **València (Spain)** in
which everyone is encouraged to participate, share their knowledge and learn
from others. Our goal is to get **technology** closer to people, regardless of
their previous knowledge, through meetups and projects.

We believe that diversity is a source of wealth in all areas and that is why we
want to **welcome all people**, whatever their, gender, age, experience, origin,
etc. 👱🧔🏽👨🌾👵 Therefore, everyone involved in the community must comply with
our code of conduct. 🖐️


## Principles

Our main goal is to build up a project that has a real purpose and impacts on
society. During this process, we encourage every contributor's **learning**
process, proactivity and **social skills**. We do our best to learn about
coding **best practices**, team **organization** and web development while
having fun.
