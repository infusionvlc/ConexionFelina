In case you don't know what **[INFUSIÓN](www.infusionvlc.com)** is,
it's a **community** based in **València (Spain)** in which everyone
is encouraged to participate, share their knowledge and learn from others.
Our goal is to get **technology** closer to people, regardless of their
previous knowledge, through meetups and projects.

We believe that diversity is a source of wealth in all areas and that is
why we want to **welcome all people**, whatever their, gender, age, experience,
origin, etc. 👱🧔🏽👨🌾👵 Therefore, everyone involved in the community must
comply with our code of conduct. 🖐️
