# Covi Project

Hey! :wave: Welcome to the **official Covi Project docs**. :books:

This project aims to introduce people to the situation of cats from cat colonies 🐱❤️

This is an application to make easier the work of the volunteers who take care of street cats, built with all the contributions our collaborators have done with a lot of effort and with a lot of love. ❤️

We believe that diversity is a source of wealth in all areas and that is why we want to **welcome all people**, whatever their, gender, age, experience, origin, etc. 👱🧔🏽👨🌾👵 Therefore, everyone involved in the community must comply with our [code of conduct](www.infusionvlc.com/rules). 🖐️

## How to Contribute

Our team is made up of people with very different experiences: developer, designers and translators. Any help is always welcome and we're always looking for more people to participate in all our projects.

You can [send us a message](mailto:hola@infusionvlc.com) and tell us a bit about yourself and what you want to help us out with. We will send you an invitation to our team's slack space.

## Open Collective

Many thanks to all the sponsors and sponsors who contribute your bit to the community! You can also join and help us continue to make use of these projects.
